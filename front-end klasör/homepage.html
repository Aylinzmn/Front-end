    <p>Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and <br>
        tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or intangible <br>
        (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value can be tracked and traded <br>
         on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.</p>
         <h2>Why blockchain is important?</h2>
         <p>Business runs on information. The faster itâ€™s received and the more accurate it is, the better. <br>
         Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and <br>
         completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by permissioned <br>
          network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. <br>
           And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, <br>
           giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.</p>
